// Write a function filterRange(arr, a, b) that gets an array arr, looks for elements with values higher or equal to a and lower or equal to b and return a result as an array.
// 1. Make a function that accepts 3 parameters, an array, and a minimum and maximum value
// 2. Declare a new array with the value of the inputted array.
// 3. Check all numbers in the new array to see if they are greater than or equal to the minimum AND less than and equal to the maximum
// 4. If numbers don't satisfy those two, remove them from the new array.
// 5. Return the new array
